                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup."
